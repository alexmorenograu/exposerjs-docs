::: tip ExposerJS ORM Supports
In order to be able to support other ORMs in the future.
Therefore we separate the code related to any orm in this library.

## Why Sequelize?

We have seen that it is one of the most used ORMs and with a very large community.
We have not yet started programming support but we would like to be able to support it in the future.
