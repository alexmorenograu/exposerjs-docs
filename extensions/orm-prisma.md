# ExposerJS x Prisma

::: tip ExposerJS ORM Supports
In order to be able to support other ORMs in the future.
Therefore we separate the code related to any orm in this library.
But to facilitate the user experience we add Prisma by default
:::

## Why Prisma?

We were looking for an orm with great support and that was one of the most used.
It is the most used orm of the big 3 to date (2023/11/XX) of download visualization in npm:

- Prisma ± 1.800.000 Weekly Downloads
- TypeORM ± 1.500.000 Weekly Downloads
- Sequelize ± 1.500.000 Weekly Downloads

We tried it and we liked it and that is why we included it by default in core of ExposerJS.
